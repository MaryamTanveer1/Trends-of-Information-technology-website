          <h1>Introdction</h1>
          <p><b>Artificial intelligence (AI)</b> is the simulation of human intelligence in robots that have been trained 
            to think and act like humans. The phrase can also refer to any machine that demonstrates human-like characteristics like learning and problem-solving.
           The ability of <b>artificial intelligence</b> to rationalise and execute actions that have the best likelihood of reaching a certain goal is its ideal feature. 
           Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that refers
            to the idea that computer systems can learn from and adapt to new data without the need for human intervention.Deep learning algorithms allow for this
            autonomous learning by absorbing large amounts of unstructured data like<b> text, photos, or video.</b>

            <h1>Articial Intelligence (AI) comprehension</h1>
            <p>
                The majority of people immediately think of robots when they hear the words artificial intelligence. 
                That's because big-budget movies and literature have human-like 
                computers wreaking devastation on the planet. Nothing, however, could be further from the truth.
                <b>Artificial intelligence </b>is founded on the idea that human intelligence may be characterised in such a way that a
                machine can simply duplicate it and carry out activities ranging from the most basic to the most complicated. 
                Artificial intelligence's goals include simulating human cognitive processes. To the extent that they can be concretely characterised, 
                researchers and developers in the field are making unexpectedly rapid progress in simulating tasks such as <b> learning, reasoning, and perception.</b> 
                Some predict that in the near future,
                innovators will be able to create systems that can learn and reason about any subject faster than humans can.
                
                <p> As <b>technology progresses, earlier artificial intelligence criteria become obsolete</b>. Machines that calculate basic calculations or 
                recognise text using optical character recognition,
                for example, are no longer called artificial intelligence because these functions are now regarded standard computer capabilities.
                
                <p>AI is constantly improving to benefit a wide range of sectors. A multidisciplinary methodology based on <b> mathematics, computer science,
                linguistics, psychology, and other disciplines is used to wire machines.</b></p>
            </p>
        </div>
  

        <div class="paragraph">
            <h1>Applications Of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
            <p>
                The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries.
                AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for <b> dosing drugs</b> and <b>different treatment in patients</b>,
                and <b>for surgical procedures in the operating room.</b></p>
                <p>
                Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play <b>chess and self-driving cars.</b>
                Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result.
                In chess, the end result is winning the game.
                For self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.</p>
                <p>Artificial intelligence is also utilised in the financial industry to detect and identify suspicious behaviour in banking and finance,
                such as irregular debit card usage and significant account deposits, which assists a bank's fraud department.
                <b>Artificial intelligence (AI) </b>applications are also being utilised to assist expedite
                and simplify trade. This is accomplished by making it easier to estimate supply, demand, and the price of securities. 
                Artificial intelligence is also utilised in the financial industry to detect and identify suspicious behaviour in banking
                and finance, such as irregular debit card usage and significant account deposits, which assists a bank's fraud department.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <h1>Classification Of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories:<b> weak and strong</b>. Weak artificial intelligence embodies
                a system designed to carry out one particular job. 
                Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri.
                You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you.
                <b>Strong artificial intelligence systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like.</b>
                These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may
                be required to problem solve without having a person intervene.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence </b>has been scrutinised by scientists and the general public since its inception. One frequent theme is that robots
                will advance to the point where humans will be unable to keep up with them, and they will take off on
                their own, recreating themselves at an exponential rate.
                <b>Another concern is that machines can be used to 
                invade people's privacy</b> and even be used as a weapon. Other debates centre on the ethics of artificial intelligence
                and whether intelligent systems like robots should be accorded the same rights as people.
                <b>Self-driving cars</b> have been a source of controversy due to their machines' tendency to be constructed with
                the least amount of risk and casualties in mind. If these cars were faced with the option of colliding with one person
                or another at the same time, they would choose the option that would do the least amount of damage.
                <b>Another much debated topic surrounding artificial intelligence is how AI can effect human jobs.</b>
                There is concern that as many businesses try to automate some tasks through the use of intelligent gear,
                individuals will be forced out of the workforce. Self-driving cars may eliminate the need for taxis and car-sharing services,
                and manufacturers may be able to simply replace human work with robots, rendering people's talents obsolete.
