        <!-- DEFINITION -->
      <div class="definition paragraph">
        <h1>Introdction</h1>
        <p>
          The world of Cyber Security revolves around the industry standard of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, or CIA. Privacy means data can be accessed only by authorized parties; integrity means information can be added, altered, or removed only by authorized users; and availability means systems, functions, and data must be available on-demand according to agreed-upon parameters.
          The main element of Cyber Security is the use of authentication mechanisms. For example, a user name identifies an account that a user wants to access, while a password is a mechanism that proves the user is who he claims to be.

        <h1>MALWARE</h1>
        <p>
          Malware is the collective name for a number of malicious software variants, including viruses, ransomware and spyware. Shorthand for malicious software, malware typically consists of code developed by cyberattackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network. Malware is typically delivered in the form of a link or file over email and requires the user to click on the link or open the file to execute the malware.

      <!-- CLOUD SECURITY -->
      <div class="cloudComputin paragraph">
        <h1>CLOUD SECURITY</h1>
        <p>
          Cloud security is the protection of data stored online via cloud computing platforms from theft, leakage, and deletion. Methods of providing cloud security include firewalls, penetration testing, obfuscation, tokenization, virtual private networks (VPN), and avoiding public internet connections.

      <div class="paragraph">
        <h1>SQL INJECTION</h1>
        <p>
          SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.</p></b>
          In some situations, an attacker can escalate an SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, or perform a denial-of-service attack.

      <!-- PASSWORD ATTACKS -->
      <div class="paragraph">
        <h1>PASSWORD ATTACKS</h1>
        <p>
          A password attack is simply when a hacker trys to steal your password. ... Because passwords can only contain so many letters and numbers, passwords are becoming less safe. Hackers know that many passwords are poorly designed, so password attacks will remain a method of attack as long as passwords are being used

        <h1>WHY CYBER SECURITY IS IMPORTANT?</h1>
        <p>
        The world relies on technology more than ever before. As a result, digital data creation has surged. Today, businesses and governments store a great deal of that data on computers and transmit it across networks to other computers. Devices and their underlying systems have vulnerabilities that, when exploited, undermine the health and objectives of an organization.
        A data breach can have a range of devastating consequences for any business. <b>It can unravel a company’s reputation through the loss of consumer and partner trust</b>. The loss of critical data, such as source files or intellectual property, can cost a company its competitive advantage. Going further, a data breach can impact corporate revenues due to non-compliance with data protection regulations. It’s estimated that, on average, a data breach costs an affected organization $3.6 million. With high-profile data breaches making media headlines, it’s essential that organizations adopt and implement a strong cybersecurity approach.

        <h1>SCOPE OF CYBER SECURITY IN 2021</h1>
        <p>
          Cyber Security is an essential component of any company or enterprise across the world, hence the scope of Cyber Security is immense. <b>Cyber Security is the technology, process, and practice, designed to protect devices, programs, and data from damages, attacks, and other unauthorized access</b>. Cyber Security is also known as Information Technology Security, focuses on protecting computers, applications, systems and networks from unauthorized access, change, or destruction. <b>The former components are the basic components of any company hence you can imagine what would the scope of cybersecurity be like</b>.
          Many authorized institutions, like the military, government agencies, financial institutions, Banking Sector, etc. have confidential information that is stored on computers and transmitted to networks. With growing cyber-attacks, it has become necessary to protect this sensitive data and personal information. Thousands and millions of Cyber Security professionals will be required to do so 
          Cybercrime is one of the rapidly increasing crimes hitting the world today. It is largely driven due to the increased exposure of information on the internet via cloud services. Networks and devices managing the infrastructure can be disrupted on a wide scale. Here stopping identity theft isn’t the only goal, but protecting data integrity is. As cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated, we need to understand their change in target, how are that affecting organizations, and their methods used in targeting.</b>
