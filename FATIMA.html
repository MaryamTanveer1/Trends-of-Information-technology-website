          <h1>Introdction</h1>
          <p>
            In 2008 the economist published a little supplement that went out with their magazine that started to introduce
            a concept of something called cloud computing and they put that quote as part of that which tell what cloud can do and the reason why should we use it.
            The on-demand availability of computer system resources, particularly data storage (cloud storage) and computational power, without direct active management by
            the user is known as cloud computing.The word refers to data centres that are accessible via the Internet to a large number of people.
            Functions from central servers are commonly dispersed across numerous locations in today's large clouds.

          <h1>HISTORY</h1>
          <p>
            In 2006, Amazon.com released its Elastic Compute Cloud product, which popularised cloud computing.
            The phrase "cloud computing" initially appeared in a Compaq internal paper in 1996, with the first recorded mention in a Compaq internal paper.
            The cloud symbol was first used to depict networks of computing equipment in 1977 in the original ARPANET, then in 1981 in the CSNET.
            The term "cloud" was first used in 1993 to describe platforms for distributed computing by Apple spin-off General Magic and AT&T in their (paired) Telescript and PersonaLink technologies.
            Andy Hertzfeld commented on Telescript, General Magic's distributed programming language, in Wired's April 1994 storey "Bill and Andy's Excellent Adventure II": The term "cloud" was mentioned.
                         <b>"The beauty of Telescript is that we now have the entire Cloud out there, where a single programme can go and go to many various sources of information 
                         and construct a sort of virtual service, rather than simply having a device to programme."</b>
            That had never occurred to anyone before.A date-arranging service is an example Jim White uses presently.

          <h1>DEFINITION</h1>
          <p>
            Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the Internet. These resources include tools and applications
            like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. As long as an electronic device has access to the web, it has access to the data.
            The widespread adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented architecture, and autonomic and utility computing, as well as the availability of high-capacity networks,
            low-cost processors and storage devices, has contributed to growth.

            <h1>CONCEPT</h1>
            <p>
                The purpose of cloud computing is to enable consumers to take advantage of all of these technologies without requiring extensive knowledge or experience in each one. 
                The cloud attempts to reduce expenses by allowing users to focus on their main business rather than being hampered by IT issues.<b> Virtualization is the primary enabler of cloud computing.
                Virtualization software divides a computer into multiple virtual machines.</b>
                To offer metrics for the services used, cloud computing employs techniques from utility computing. Other grid computing methods' QoS (quality of service) and reliability difficulties 
                are addressed by cloud computing.

                  Client–server model—Any distributed application that distinguishes between service providers and service requestors is referred to as client–server computing.

              <li>
                  From the 1960s to the 1980s, a computer bureau was a service bureau that provided computer services.

                  Grid computing is a type of distributed and parallel computing in which a'super and virtual computer' is made up of a group of networked, loosely attached computers that work together to complete very big jobs.

              <li>
                    Fog computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings data, compute, storage, and application services closer to clients and near-user edge devices like network routers.<b> Furthermore,
                    instead of transferring data to a remote site for processing, fog computing manages data on the network, on smart devices, and on the end-user client-side</b> (e.g. mobile devices).
